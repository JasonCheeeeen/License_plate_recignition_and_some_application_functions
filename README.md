# License plate recognition and some application functions
In this project, it cotained some application functions and implement of the license plate recognition.

## Application functions
You can try to use the function made by myself and input your image which you want, you will see the transformation of your image.</br>
Like, Binalization, Watermark, split image into two part which could not see clearly and merge them into origin.</br>
Also, this functions will help you to implement the next theme - license plate recognition.

## License plate recognition
License plate recognition is ubiquitous in parking lots, so i want to implement it by myself with methods of image processing.</br> 
In order to increase its recogntion's speed, i use deep learning(CNN) to train the model of number and alphabet.</br>
Finally, using thread to recognize, and all of these are implemented by python.</br>
Also, i have uploaded a pdf file which contain the algorithm of how to implement license plate recognition and each procedure's output image.
So i think it can help you to realize how to implement it simply.
